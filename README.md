# scenfirepy

`scenfirepy` is a Python implementation of the SCENFIRE framework for building fire-size scenarios by selecting simulated fire events that reproduce a target historical fire-size distribution.

The package mirrors the logic and goals of the original SCENFIRE R package: https://github.com/rmmarcos/SCENFIRE_package
- preprocess FLP20 / fire simulation outputs
- build target fire-size distributions
- select simulated events to match historical regimes
- support burn probability and scenario analysis
