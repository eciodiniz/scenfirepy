# scenfirepy

`scenfirepy` is a Python implementation for building fire-size scenarios by selecting simulated fire events that reproduce a target historical fire hazard, fire-size distribution, and fire severity.

This Python library mirrors the logic of the SCENFIRE R package: https://github.com/rmmarcos/SCENFIRE_package, thus allowing the user, for instance, to:
- preprocess FLP20 / fire simulation outputs
- build target fire-size distributions
- select simulated events to match historical regimes
- support burn probability and scenario analysis
